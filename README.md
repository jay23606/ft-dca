Firstrade DCA bot using headless browser (microsoft.playwright)

Make sure playwright is installed using these instructions:

https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/intro

This command may also be required for the pwsh command

dotnet tool install --global PowerShell

Update login tag in config.xml and the symbols you would like to DCA
  
Still has some bugs I am working through

Would also like to add a class to support Robinhood
